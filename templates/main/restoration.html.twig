{% block credits %}I wrote this little tool because I always found it difficult to tell an entertainer which buffs I wanted from him without knowing what buffs were available. Unfortunately SWG doesn't make this info available to the player and information on the internet on this topic is very sparse. I eventually ended up leveling an entertainer myself, just to be able to play around with different buff configurations, which I don't think should be the way to go. So I tried to come up with an alternative solution, hoping to make it a little easier for newer players to get into the entertainer buffing aspect of the game.<br>
